## üìç About
Sudoku solver in Pascal. The program will attempt to solve a user-provided sudoku board. It can also log all actions and the resultant board to an external file.

Sorry, the code is horrifying, I know. The design principal was to get the algroithms working, rather than to make them clean and sustainable. Attempting to improve the code may only lead to more frustration than you have now.
